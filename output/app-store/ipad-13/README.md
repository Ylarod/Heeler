# Heeler iPad App Store mockups

Seven landscape exports for the 13-inch iPad screenshot slot. Each export is
an opaque RGB PNG at 2752 × 2064 pixels. The numbered filenames define the proposed
upload order, with the floating-window presentation first.

## Contents

| Order | Export | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `exports/01-fits-your-workspace.png` | A real floating Heeler window on iPad |
| 2 | `exports/02-every-agent-one-console.png` | Agent sidebar and a selected Claude Code conversation |
| 3 | `exports/03-type-directly-stay-in-flow.png` | Direct Input with its shortcut row and the iOS keyboard |
| 4 | `exports/04-see-what-changed.png` | Changes for an Agent's Checkout beside the Agent sidebar |
| 5 | `exports/05-every-change-line-by-line.png` | A file's side-by-side diff with edited words marked |
| 6 | `exports/06-skills-within-reach.png` | Skills in the Direct Input tools keyboard |
| 7 | `exports/07-a-shell-when-you-need-one.png` | Terminals sidebar and a Shell Terminal in Keys mode |

`contact-sheet.jpg` provides an overview; `index.html` links the seven full-size
exports. Neither the contact sheet nor the source captures belong in the upload
set. The locally generated `../ipad-13-app-store.zip` contains only the seven
exports and is excluded from Git.

## Source preservation

- The sources are real captures from the iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) (16GB) simulator
  on iOS 27.0, UDID `A993BBE0-BD87-4807-8541-34A23C15C6A9`, taken on 2026-09-28
  against a live herdr on this Mac. They show the iPad sidebar console. The
  console, windowed, and Changes captures were retaken on 2026-10-02.
- The same captures are copied to `docs/images/*-ipad.png` for the README and to
  `landing/src/assets/screens/*-ipad.png` for the landing page.
- The session titles in the captures remain in Chinese, as captured.
- Source captures are copied unchanged. The renderer scales each 4:3 capture
  uniformly to 2112 × 1584, with a small rounded corner mask. It does not redraw,
  rearrange, stretch, or replace any application content.
- The generated background is shared with `../iphone-6.9/assets/background.png`.
  Headlines, subheads, frame, and shadow are deterministic compositions adapted
  from the existing iPhone renderer and the approved iPad HTML preview.
- Source and export SHA-256 values, copy, geometry, and format are recorded in
  `manifest.json`.

The English marketing copy follows the existing App Store set. Additional
localized variants have not been produced.

## Scope and verification

All seven rendered PNGs and the contact sheet were visually inspected. The
renderer checks source dimensions, equal scale on both axes, headline and
subhead safe areas, and output dimensions/color mode. An independent `sips`
check confirmed 2752 × 2064 and `hasAlpha: no` for every export. No App Store
Connect upload or product-page preview was performed.

## Regenerate

From the repository root, with Pillow installed:

```sh
python3 output/app-store/ipad-13/compose_mockups.py
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight -g hasAlpha output/app-store/ipad-13/exports/*.png
ditto -c -k --norsrc --keepParent output/app-store/ipad-13/exports output/app-store/ipad-13-app-store.zip
```

The renderer uses the system SF fonts on macOS. No application build or test is
needed to regenerate these marketing assets.
